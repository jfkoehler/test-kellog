# Mathematical Models

This weeks resources focus on providing more detailed information about the mathematics behind many models we have encountered to this point.  The materials are a mixture of readings and jupyter notebooks, and are broken into standard conceptual blocks.

## Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, we know the labels of some data that we would like to predict.  Both classification and regression are examples of supervised learning problems.

- [**Introduction to Supervised Learning**](supervised/01-Overview-of-Regression-Classification.pdf): Chapter from Introduction to Statistical Learning discussing big picture of regression and classification problems with accompanying R code.

- [**Overview of Supervised Learning**](supervised/ESL_supervised.pdf): Chapter from Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL) on big idea of supervised learning.

### Linear Regression
